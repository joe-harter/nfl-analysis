This repository is used simply to house various playgrounds and models of data from the NFLVerse Dataset https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data

Thanks to that team and especially Tan Ho for making this available.

## Set Up

Create a virtual environment. I prefer [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html)

This project uses Python 3.10. Create an environment with

```bash
conda create -n nfl-analysis python=3.10
```

Activate the virtual environment with

```bash
conda activate nfl-analysis
```

Install all python dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
